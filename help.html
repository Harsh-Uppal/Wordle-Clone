    <p>
        After pressing enter, R just turned <span class="yellow">yellow</span>.
        It means that 'R' is in the word but not at the 4<sup>th</sup> position.
        If any letter turns <span class="green">green</span>, it means that the letter is in the word and at the same
        positon.
        The letters that do not turn green or yellow they are not in the word.
        Using all the clues, try to guess the word in the least attempts.
